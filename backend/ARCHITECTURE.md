## Overview of Major Components

The `CaloriSee API Service` is a modular, scalable backend application designed to provide food recognition, logging, and nutritional information retrieval functionality. It leverages modern web technologies and cloud-based services to deliver high performance and reliability.

### 1. **API Layer**
   - **Technology:** Node.js with Express framework.
   - **Purpose:** Handles incoming HTTP requests, routes them to appropriate controllers, and returns responses.
   - **Endpoints:**
     - **Authentication** (`/api/v2/auth/*`): Handles user registration, login, and profile management.
     - **Logs** (`/api/v2/logs/*`): Manages meal logs including creation, retrieval, and deletion.
     - **Food Recognition** (Planned feature): Processes uploaded images to identify food items and retrieves their nutritional information.

### 2. **Database Layer**
   - **Technology:** MongoDB.
   - **Purpose:** Stores user information, meal logs, and metadata.
   - **Collections:**
     - `users`: Stores user profiles, authentication credentials, and preferences.
     - `logs`: Stores meal logs with timestamped entries and nutritional details.
   - **Features:**
     - Indexed for fast querying by user ID and timestamps.
     - Schema validation to ensure data integrity.

### 3. **Caching Layer**
   - **Technology:** Redis.
   - **Purpose:**
     - Speeds up frequent queries by caching responses.
     - Stores user session data and tokens for fast authentication.
     - Temporary storage for rate limiting and real-time metrics.

### 4. **AI Model (Planned Feature)**
   - **Technology:** TensorFlow.js / Pre-trained model via external API (e.g., Google Vision API).
   - **Purpose:** Processes images uploaded by users to identify food items and returns recognized elements.

### 5. **Monitoring and Logging**
   <!-- - **Monitoring Tools:** Prometheus for metrics collection.
   - **Visualization:** Grafana for real-time dashboards. -->
   - **Logging:** Winston logger with custom transports.
     - Logs are categorized by levels (`info`, `warn`, `error`).
     - Logs are written to files and sent to a centralized logging service.

## How Requests Flow Through the System

1. **Incoming Request:**
   - A client sends an HTTP request to the API.
2. **Routing:**
   - Express routes the request to the appropriate controller based on the endpoint.
3. **Authentication:**
   - The `authMiddleware` checks the presence and validity of the authentication token.
   - If valid, the request proceeds to the next step.
   - If invalid, a `401 Unauthorized` response is returned.
4. **Controller Execution:**
   - The controller handles the business logic (e.g., creating a meal log, fetching logs).
   - The controller interacts with the database (MongoDB) and caching layer (Redis) as needed.
5. **Response:**
   - The controller returns the response to the client.
   - If an error occurs, the `errorHandler` middleware formats and sends an error response.
